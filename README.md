# triggerbox

camera triggering with clock synchronization to host PCs

## firmware build and install

This firmware can be compiled and installed with the Arduino IDE or at
the command line.

### Arduino IDE compilation

The file `triggerbox.ino` in the folder `firmware/triggerbox` can be opened
directly in the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software).

### Command-line compilation

To build this firmware for an Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno board on Ubuntu linux, do
the following steps.

Install the required software:

    curl -O http://debs.strawlab.org/xenial/arduino-udev_0.2.3-0ads1_all.deb
    sudo apt install ./arduino-udev_0.2.3-0ads1_all.deb
    sudo apt-get install arduino-mk

Make the firmware and upload it onto your Arduino device. With Arduino Nano:

    # Do this if you are using an Arduino Nano
    cd firmware/triggerbox
    ln -s Makefile.nano Makefile
    make upload

With Arduino Uno:

    # Do this if you are using an Arduino Uno
    cd firmware/triggerbox
    ln -s Makefile.uno Makefile
    make upload

## Device setup

After building and uploading firmware to the device, its name must be saved
to it with the [arduino-udev](https://github.com/strawlab/arduino-udev)
package.

In the below, replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with `/dev/ttyACM0` if needed. This is
needed with Arduino Uno hardware, for example.

Unplug and replug the triggerbox, then run this to flash the EEPROM on the
device with its new name (which will be `trig1`):

    arduino-udev-name --set-name trig1 --verbose /dev/ttyUSB0

Now, run the udev rules to make a symlink to the device at `/dev/trig1`:

    udevadm control --reload-rules
    udevadm trigger --attr-match=subsystem=tty
    ls /dev/trig1

## Troubleshooting

If your device is at `/dev/ttyACM0`, the `modemmanager` package may interfere
with its normal operation. Therefore, ensure you do not have modemmanager
installed:

    apt-get remove modemmanager

If the commands above in device setup suceeded but there is no device at
`/dev/trig1`, check the output of:

    arduino-udev-name /dev/ttyUSB0

If the output is `trig1`, this means the `--set-name` command above succeeded.
However, since there is no device at `/dev/trig1`, this means the udev rules
from the `arduino-udev` package are not working as expected. In this case, check
the output of `lsusb` for the VendorID and ProductID of your trigger device and
ensure they are in the udev rules file from the `arduino-udev` package. (The
rules file is typically installed at `/lib/udev/rules.d/99-arduino-udev.rules`.)
